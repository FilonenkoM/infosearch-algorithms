# Informational Research algorithms
When I was studying the appropriate course at the university, I've written several tools to implement some algorithms of informational research.
- dict implements basic indexing with or without multithreading.
- fuzzy_indices contains my attempts to implement trigram index. permutation index and inverted index algorithms for phrase search. 
- in large_index project I've tried to create a program for indexing a big file, using blocks and merging them.
- multi_index project is about combining several indexes to achieve high perfomance.
- in zone_search I've tried to use xml library to search in some parts of the document with different weights for each zone. However, it does not work as expected.
- vector_model project contains algorithms for basic vector search and indexing. 

### The algorithms are not properly tested, so I highly don't recommend to use my implementations in non-investigation purposes.
